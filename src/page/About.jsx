                  <p className="about_sec1_p_1">
                    When asked why Roger and Tracy started O2 Global Inc, Roger
                    replied, "I have been blessed with the ability to foresee and
                    navigate market trends in the ever changing economy,
                    ultimately creating multiple streams of income. In searching
                    for the perfect balance in a company, I continue to create
                    products and services that could create an equitable and
                    profitable incentive plan for acquiring customers and teaching
                    others to do the same. When seeing the current business
                    landscape and understanding what it takes to succeed in
                    today’s business climate, the desire of the executive
                    management team is to continue to provide the ability to
                    improve lives around the world, not only financially, but also
                    through lifestyle, relationships, and emotional development.”

                    Roger and Tracy met in 1997 and solidified their relationship
                    in 2004. At that time, Tracy was pursuing a teaching degree in
                    college, while Roger had already dedicated nearly a decade to
                    building a successful team, which eventually disbanded
                    following the collapse of the company they worked for.
                    Following this setback, Roger spent the next two decades
                    consulting for numerous network marketing companies, striving
                    to recreate the success he once enjoyed. Realizing that the
                    key to finding success was to create it himself, Roger took
                    the initiative to establish his own path. A passionate and
                    driven professional, Roger attributes his achievements to his
                    core values and upbringing. His true fulfillment comes from
                    helping others achieve their dreams, aligning his career with
                    his calling to improve lives. Roger's expertise in direct
                    marketing encompasses everything from conception to launch
                    planning, bonus plan development and implementation, marketing
                    strategies, training systems, team building, product
                    development, organizational launch and pre-launch structure
                    and management, to conventions, seminars, set and stage
                    design, and recognition systems. Roger’s dedication to his
                    profession and commitment to others underscores his passion
                    for transforming lives through innovative and effective
                    marketing strategies.

                      We understand that travel transforms individuals and fosters
                      cultural understanding, and contributes to the preservation
                      of our world’s natural and cultural heritage. With this in
                      mind, we set out on a mission to curate exceptional travel
                      experiences that cater to different interests, preferences,
                      and budgets. And so, Escape Trips became our first initial
                      product offering.
